# Portfolio 2.0

This project explores frontend architecture by integrating
a React micro-frontend into an Angular shell using Module Federation.

## Architecture
- Angular: Host / Shell
- React (Vite): Remote / Micro-frontend

## Key Concepts
- Runtime loading
- Explicit lifecycle (mount / unmount)
- Contract-based communication
- ESM-compatible Module Federation

## Why
Built to understand and demonstrate real-world frontend architecture,
not just framework usage.

One single entry point, based on the viewer selection of angualr or react
we call it as mindset
angualr has structured applciation
react will flexible

Angular Shell (Host)

├── Context / Work / Thinking

└── React Remote
    └── Loaded only when user chooses "React mindset"


    because:

 You want to show framework coexistence
 You want to demonstrate architectural decisions
 You want a real talking point for interviews
 You want future-ready skills


Why Angular as Host is SMART

Angular has first-class Module Federation tooling
Strong routing & structure
Better shell control
React stays independent and expressive
This aligns with:

Angular = structured
React = flexible

Which matches your portfolio story perfectly.


What You’ll Actually Learn (Valuable Stuff)
By doing this, you’ll genuinely learn:
Module Federation concepts
Runtime composition vs build-time
Shared dependencies
App boundaries
Deployment strategies

When MFEs are worth it vs not




Important Rule (So it doesn’t spiral)

We do this in phases.

Phase 1 — Conceptual Success
Angular loads React page
Navigation works
No styling perfection
That’s a win.

Phase 2 — Integration Polish
Shared styles
Shared theme
Shared analytics (later n8n 👀)

Phase 3 — Documentation
You explain why you did this
That’s portfolio gold

🛠️ Tooling We’ll Use (No surprises)
Angular + @angular-architects/module-federation
React + Vite Module Federation plugin

No hacks
No iframe nonsense
Industry-aligned setup.

How you can explain this confidently (later)
You’ll be able to say:
“I explored micro-frontend architecture by using Angular as a shell and React as a remote, 
focusing on framework coexistence and runtime composition rather than complexity.”

That sentence alone is interviewer bait.
